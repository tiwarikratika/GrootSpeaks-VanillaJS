except that it makes use of an API which converts our English language to 
the language of Groot.

<h2>What is VanillaJS?</h2>
The term vanilla script is used to refer to the pure
JavaScript (or we can say plain JavaScript) without any type of additional library. 
So basically, I have written this app using pure JAvascript without ny other libraries.

<h2>What is an API? <?h2>

API is the acronym for Application Programming Interface, which is a software intermediary that allows two applications to talk to each other.
